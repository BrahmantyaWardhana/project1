    <p>John Frusciante is the guitarist for the rock band the Red Hot Chilli Peppers</p>
    <p>They're songs are what got me into guitar playing. I learned how to play by playing their songs, since they are not too difficult to learn</p>
    <p>I've been listening to them ever since I could remember. It was my dad who introduced me to them</p>
    <p>This video is my favorite performance of John Frusciante</p>
